# Tips calculator

### Since I used to work in hospitality industry while learning programming, I wrote this simple tips calculator as a practice
[www](https://tips-kolektor.vercel.app/)

I was quite tired while when closing the bar around 2Am so I wanted to make it as fast as posible. An I definitely did not have any energy to count anything. So this works like this:
1. Write names of all people working that day
2. Add to each of them how many hours they've been working
3. Add the total amount of tips for that shift
4. You will get the tips for each person

#### Technologies:
- React
- Tailwind

The design is quite simple, because I wanted to write it as soon as possible.

(the calculator is still used at that bar)
